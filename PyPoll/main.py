# PyPoll Homework

#Import Python dependencies
import os
import csv

#CSV Election Data file path
PyPollCSV = os.path.join('Resources', 'election_data.csv')

#Name the output text file
output_file = "PyPoll.txt"

#Define variables to be used
votes = 0



#Calculate the total number of votes cast

#Populate a complete list of candidates who received votes

# -The percentage of votes each candidate won

# -The total number of votes each candidate won

# -The winner of the election based on popular vote.

#Your analysis should look similar to the following:


  #```text
  #Election Results
  #-------------------------
  #Total Votes: 369711
  #-------------------------
  #Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
  #Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
  #Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
  #-------------------------
  #Winner: Diana DeGette
  #-------------------------
  #```

# In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
