# Python-Challenge
Homework 3 - Northwestern Data Science Boot Camp

For this challenge, we were asked to create 2 different codes to read through different CSV files and output text files also.

# PyBank:
This part consisted of analyzing the financial records of my company using the budget_data.csv file provided.
From here, the Python script analyzed the CSV file and successfully calculated:
-The total number of months included in the dataset
-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
