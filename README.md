# Python-Challenge
Homework 3 - Northwestern Data Science Boot Camp

For this challenge, we were asked to create 2 different codes to read through different CSV files and output text files also.

# PyBank:
This part consisted of analyzing the financial records of my company using the budget_data.csv file provided.

From here, the Python script analyzed the CSV file and successfully calculated:

-The total number of months included in the dataset

-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

-The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

-The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

This same script was able to output these results into the terminal and a separate .txt file with the following results:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $22564198
  Average Change: $-8311.11
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
  ```
