#  Calculate each of the following:

# -The total number of months included in the dataset

# -The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

# -The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

# -The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

# -The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

#Your analysis should look similar to the following:

  #```text
  #Financial Analysis
  #----------------------------
  #Total Months: 86
  #Total: $22564198
  #Average Change: $-8311.11
  #Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
  #Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
  #```

# In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
